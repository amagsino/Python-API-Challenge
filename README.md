# What's the Weather Like?

## Observations Based on Data
1. There is a correlation between latitude and temperature. As one approaches the equator, which is represented by 0 Degrees Latitude, the temperature becomes significantly warmer. However, the weather peaks at -20 Degrees Latitude, rather than at 0 Degrees Latitude, which may be due to obliquity, the angle of tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation.
2. In regards to the date that the data was collected, it is much warmer in the southern hemisphere, which is represented by negative Degrees of Latitude compared to the northern hemisphere represented by positive degrees of Latitude. It is currently Fall season in the northern hemisphere and Summer season in the southern hemisphere. The highest recorded temperature in the southern hemisphere is about 100 Degrees F, while the lowest recorded temperature in the northern hemisphere is about -40 Degrees F.
3. Wind speed is generally between 0 and 15mph regardless of latitude, with some few points beyond that range and the highest recorded wind speed of about 50mph.
